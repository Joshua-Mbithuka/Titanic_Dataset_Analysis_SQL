The Titanic dataset data analysis aimed to uncover patterns and insights related to passenger demographics and their survival outcomes during the Titanic tragedy. The analysis sought to answer questions regarding the factors influencing survival rates, particularly focusing on age, gender, and passenger class.

**Objectives:**

* Age Distribution: Investigate how age impacted survival rates, identifying trends among children, the elderly, and middle-aged individuals.
* Gender and Survival: Examine the role of gender in determining survival outcomes, assessing if women had a significantly higher survival rate than men.
* Passenger Class: Explore the relationship between socio-economic status (reflected in passenger class) and survival rates, determining if there was a correlation between first-class passengers and higher chances of survival.

**TOOLS and skills Used** : SQL, Exploratory data analysis
**Insights uncovered**
* Age Distribution: Younger passengers (children) had a better survival rate, while the elderly had lower survival chances. Middle-aged individuals, especially males, formed the bulk of casualties.
* Gender and Survival: Women had a significantly higher survival rate than men.
* Passenger Class: First-class passengers had a higher survival rate, indicating socio-economic status played a role in survival chances.
